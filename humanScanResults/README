This directory contains the classification output from Schrider and Kern's (2017; https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/34/8/1863/3804550) scan for selective sweeps in six human population samples using S/HIC (Schrider and Kern 2016; PMID: 26977894). Contents:

windowClassifications: a directory containing the bed coordinates of the raw S/HIC output.

windowClassificationsRecombFilter: a directory containing the same files as above, but filtered to remove windows with a recombination rate estimate of 0.0 from Kong et al. (2010).

all_sweeps_merged.bed: a file containing the coordinates of all distinct sweeps merged across populations (as described in the paper), along with the set of populations in which the sweep was found, and the predicted type of sweep (hard or soft) for each population.

all_sweeps_merged_genes.bed: same as above but with an additional column: a comma-separated list of all genes contained within or overlapping the candidate sweep region.

summaryStats.tgz: contains summary statistics calculated in each population in order to generate S/HIC's feature vectors. Note that these were calculated for chromosomal segments, and there is some overlap between these segments for making downstream feature vector calculation more convenient. Thus some windows appear in multiple files.

permuteOrderOfSweepCallRunsByChr.py: a simple python script for permuting the order of S/HIC's calls (with runs of adjacent classifications preserved). Arguments: 1) path to a BED file with S/HIC classifications, 2) the number of permutations, and 3) output directory where all permuted BED files will be written.
